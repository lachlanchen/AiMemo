      <h2>Design logic</h2>
      <p>
        This repo is the launchpad for AiMemo; the IdeasGlass memo project houses the LLM trigger and table export
        work. AiMemo blends email leadership from AISecretary, itinerary-focused sections, and the memory-first
        philosophy from IdeasGlass so that you can stay ahead of every plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is a single assistant that routes natural language to precise tables, keeps conversations legible, and
        augments an inbox with actionable insight. memo.lazying.art is the home of that vision.
